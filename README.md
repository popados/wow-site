## Specifications

🎨 Visual & Design Direction

Occasional gold or bone-white for highlights (titles, borders).

Textures:

Subtle rough stone or leather textures for section backgrounds.

Maybe wood/metal separators between sections.

Fonts:

Headings → bold tribal/brutalistic fonts (something like Cinzel, UnifrakturCook, or MedievalSharp).

Body text → clean readable sans-serif (like Roboto or Open Sans).

Icons/Accents:

Horde/Alliance symbols, parchment scrolls, tribal patterns, spikes/chains as dividers.

⚒️ Layout Structure
Navigation

Sticky top bar, chunky blocky buttons.

Links → About | Gallery | Blog | Addons | Macros | Shop

Faction symbols or WoW glyphs as hover indicators.

Hero Section

Full-width brutalistic image (e.g. Orgrimmar gates, tribal Horde banners, or a WoW-inspired landscape).

Optional CTA: “Read the Blog” or “Browse Addons”.

About

Content:

Short intro (“I’m a WoW player since Burning Crusade...”)

List of expansions played (styled like carved runes or banners).

Current guild/faction emblem.

Gallery

Lightbox gallery.

Screenshots, fan art, or character shots.

Each thumbnail framed with rough borders (like cracked stone).

Blog

Articles on guides, reviews, lore thoughts.

Brutalist grid of posts: blocks with bold titles, each with earthy section backgrounds.

LUA/Addons

Tutorial-style content.

Sections: “Beginner’s Guide to Addons”, “Useful Addons List”, “How to Build Your First Addon”.

Code snippets styled like parchment scrolls or stone tablets.

Macros

Tabs or accordions for: General, Class-Specific, PvP.

Each macro in a styled code box.

Shop

Grid layout.

WoW merch (shirts, mugs, collectibles).

PC peripherals (keyboards, mice, headsets) – styled as WoW gear cards (name, rarity color, maybe even item-like borders).

🌍 Extra Touches

Section dividers shaped like jagged spikes, tusks, or totem poles.

Cursor hover effects → glowing tribal runes.

Background music toggle (like a WoW tavern track).

“Latest Kill” or “Current Raid Progress” widget in sidebar.

👉 Would you like me to sketch out a wireframe-style layout in HTML/CSS so you can plug in content, or do you want me to first help design a color palette + font pairing before diving into code?

### Day 001 | 9/23/2025 - Tuesday

- Created initial README.md file for wow-blog project.
- Outlined project specifications and design direction.
- Planned layout structure and extra touches for the website.

Making a new website today. This one will be a World of Warcraft themed site. Maybe a blog or a fan site. Not sure yet. Need to figure out the layout and design. Also need to get some content up.

The site layout will be brutalistic and tribal themed. Colors will be dark and earthy. Fonts will be bold and strong. Each section will have a background color to differentiate it from the others. This will help with the brutalistic theme. Content that shows I am a WoW player and fan. Maybe some guides or reviews. Also want to add a shop section for WoW merch and PC peripherals.

  - theme picture

update hero section to include a picture and frame/diagonal line that shows alliance/horde as well as keeping to the tribal/brutalistic theme of blocky dividers
